## Just clone and run within the directory

```
cd /ProjectDir/node app
```
the default port should be 3000 but it should spit out something like this

```
Server started on port 3000
```
so you'll know what port to put it on. Then go to your web browser and copy and paste this in
```
localhost:3000
```
and just create an account and the login to the profile will be set up shortly!
